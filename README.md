## How to compile *THIS PROJECT*
Hi, I'm so sorry you're here. Anyways, lets do this.

You need to be on the 2019 branch, not the 2020 branch (that contains the real code). If you are installing flutter for the first time, try to get dart version 3.5.4 but this uses almost no libraries so you can change ``pubspec.yaml`` line 17 and probably have no issues. 

To build just run ``flutter build web`` and then copy the contents of ``build/web`` to ``pos/`` of the master branch.
